<description>&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; Harry Potter ideas too small to have their own entries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; How about a Sirius-style prank on Moony that the child of a werewolf and a witch will be a leprechaun? (&lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11160991/21/0800-Rent-A-Hero&quot; title=&quot;External link to https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11160991/21/0800-Rent-A-Hero&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;inspiration&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Why not put a new spin on the &quot;Parselmouths are good lovers&quot; fanon cliché by having it that speaking parseltongue does give you an &lt;em&gt;advantage&lt;/em&gt; (perhaps by training up useful tongue muscles), but Voldemort is a mediocre lover &lt;em&gt;despite&lt;/em&gt; that. (&lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9051968/5/Harry-Potter-Unexpected-Animagus&quot; title=&quot;External link to https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9051968/5/Harry-Potter-Unexpected-Animagus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;inspiration&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hermione could notice that a floo password in Gobbledygook is an extra layer of security because, even if you hear it, most wizards won't know the difference between the phonetics and the phonology. (Which aspects of the sounds are significant) (&lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9051968/4/Harry-Potter-Unexpected-Animagus&quot; title=&quot;External link to https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9051968/4/Harry-Potter-Unexpected-Animagus&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;inspiration&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; How about &quot;Malfoy, did your father bribe the sorting hat? ...because I've yet to see you be cunning in the slightest.&quot; for a line in a fic?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; How might Voldemort react to discovering that Harry Potter, known to be alive but not having turned up at Hogwarts, is under the protection of an allied bloc of dark families outside Britain whose numbers and power greatly exceed his own, but who see him as a mad dog and a big threat to their own political efforts? (Inspired by a random thought while reading &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2695781/36/&quot; title=&quot;External link to http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2695781/36/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gabriel, Chapter 36&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; &quot;I've been to New Zealand once &lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; that's about the furthest you could potentially portkey, unless you make one that has multiple stops. You shouldn't worry.&quot; &lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7060807/6/Death_Shall_Have_No_Dominion&quot; title=&quot;External link to http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7060807/6/Death_Shall_Have_No_Dominion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Death Shall Have No Dominion, Chapter 6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; I don't think I've ever seen a Harry Potter fic where Lucius and Draco Malfoy die or are otherwise taken out of the equation and some squib (or person mistaken for a squib) or supposedly banished relative with little love for the pureblood cause somehow manages to inherit. That could make for interesting character interactions if done well.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; I wonder if there's any situation where The Daily Prophet could be shown as not even printing the truth about Harry Potter's birth notice. (&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:;&quot; title=&quot;show Inspiration&quot; class=&quot;button&quot; closedtext=&quot;Inspiration&quot; closedtip=&quot;show Inspiration&quot; openedtext=&quot;Inspiration&quot; openedtip=&quot;hide Inspiration&quot; hover=&quot;false&quot;&gt;Inspiration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;floatingPanel&quot; transient=&quot;true&quot; style=&quot;display: none; left: 0px; top: 0px;&quot;&gt;&quot;Open your eyes. Think for yourself. For fourteen years, they made me out to be some kind of spectacular hero, when really I'm just a normal kid who had something horrible happen to his family. They've spent the last year making me out to be some unstable liar, when again I'm just a normal kid who had some horrible things happen to him. As far as I can tell, the last thing the Prophet printed about me that was accurate was my birth notice back in 1980.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7725072/4/Harry_and_Luna_Against_the_High_Inquisitor&quot; title=&quot;External link to http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7725072/4/Harry_and_Luna_Against_the_High_Inquisitor&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Harry and Luna Against the High Inquisitor, Chapter 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Perhaps an HP story where someone illegally breeds spider monkeys or capuchin monkeys capable of using magic and someone (maybe Fred and/or George) winds up with one as a pet? (&lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4183350/14/&quot; title=&quot;External link to http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4183350/14/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;inspiration&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; One thing occurs to me. Why doesn't a time-travelling or super Harry ever send through some large, irritable, hard-to-kill magical creature when he recognizes a portkey sent by Voldemort's followers to trap him?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; I know trust can go a long way, but if only the marauders had understood enough about the effects of torture, they could probably have crafted an unbreakable vow that would kill Wormtail before he could divulge the Fidelius secret... just to be sure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Interesting forgotten point about Voldemort. He rarely gives his word, but tries hard to keep it. (eg. The lengths he went to ensure Lily the opportunity to surrender and be saved for Snape.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; &quot;Draco may be a jerk, but you have to keep things in perspective. His father is the right-hand man of Lord Jerk himself. It's sort of the family business.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;javascript:;&quot; title=&quot;show inspiration&quot; class=&quot;button&quot; closedtext=&quot;inspiration&quot; closedtip=&quot;show inspiration&quot; openedtext=&quot;inspiration&quot; openedtip=&quot;hide inspiration&quot; hover=&quot;false&quot;&gt;inspiration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;floatingPanel&quot; transient=&quot;true&quot; style=&quot;display: none; left: 0px; top: 0px;&quot;&gt;Inspired by &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1768603/4/Flawed_Perfection&quot; title=&quot;External link to http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1768603/4/Flawed_Perfection&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flawed Perfection, Chapter 4&lt;/a&gt; and, in another amusing convergence, almost duplicated by &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1768603/4/Flawed_Perfection&quot; title=&quot;External link to http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1768603/4/Flawed_Perfection&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flawed Perfection, Chapter 5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Add &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1835747/1/&quot; title=&quot;External link to http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1835747/1/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;806&lt;/a&gt; to my list of things to complete once I'm more skilled.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; I'd really like to see a well-done sequel/continuation to nonjon's &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7395979/1/Whatever_Happened_to_the_Likely_Lad&quot; title=&quot;External link to http://www.fanfiction.net/s/7395979/1/Whatever_Happened_to_the_Likely_Lad&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Whatever Happened to the Likely Lad?&lt;/a&gt; or something functionally equivalent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What if Godric Gryffindor had been a wandering spirit and, deciding to provide a long-lasting prank on future headmasters and staff, gave the Sorting Hat a foreign name like Alejandro.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Draco appeared in what appeared to be a modest guest room with his pants around his ankles and fell over backwards. &quot;What?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lucius rolled his eyes, knowing his son had no doubt been amusing himself with his twin sister the squib. Normally he'd give his son a lecture over such behavior as it was a trifle tasteless, but squibs weren't useful for much else until they reached adulthood and could be sacrificed for a slight increase in power of course.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Besides he could hardly throw stones considering the number of muggleborns he'd collected and played with while waiting for their 21st birthdays to boost his own modest core.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3776911/20/&quot; title=&quot;External link to http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3776911/20/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3776911/20/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Those last two paragraphs would make for one hell of an intro to a novel take on this plot in a longer fic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All of the fics that go in this direction that I've seen have Harry breaking free, rather than Harry remaining in his role and Dumbledore struggling to fix the mistakes he's just realized he made.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Hell, it'd be even more interesting if this IS a manipulative &quot;Harry is a weapon&quot; Dumbledore because, instead of him honestly begging for forgiveness, he'd be rationally scheming... to give Harry something to live for. I've NEVER seen that angle explored and I've read a lotta fics.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; My response to &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6280893/1/Words-Have-Meaning&quot; title=&quot;External link to https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6280893/1/Words-Have-Meaning&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6280893/1/Words-Have-Meaning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/strong&gt; I've seen plenty of stories where manipulative Dumbledore tries to set up Harry with Ginny from the beginning. The key here being that we've got a Harry who's already jaded and familiar with the other characters' normal behaviour, so Dumbledore would have a hard time just following the old tropes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ponder these for ideas:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; A Hermione who fled a world where Voldemort won discovers that Dumbledore somehow imbued her penseive memory of him with portrait-style sentience. &lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1052076/5/Childs_Play&quot; title=&quot;External link to http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1052076/5/Childs_Play&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Child's Play, Chapter 5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; It's an almost unknown fact that, in approximately the same percentage as wizards, some muggles are born immune to all magic including the killing curse. &lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1052076/8/Childs_Play&quot; title=&quot;External link to http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1052076/8/Childs_Play&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Child's Play, Chapter 8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Idea bins open for public use:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4408541/1/In_Search_of_a_Plot&quot; title=&quot;External link to http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4408541/1/In_Search_of_a_Plot&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;In Search of a Plot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Idea bins of uncertain permission status:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4100615/1/Accio_Brain&quot; title=&quot;External link to http://www.fanfiction.net/s/4100615/1/Accio_Brain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Accio Brain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

<title>Odds and Ends</title>
<description>&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; Unsorted bits and bobs... usually too short to have their own page.&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; How about writing my own &quot;Odd Ideas&quot;?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Try writing a report/log/journal-style story like The Virus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; ...heck, why not try some &quot;What if...?&quot; stories exploring how differently various series set in the future might go if Nerimavirus has become simply a part of what it means to be human.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stuff too short for its own page:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; &quot;Hulk Sell!&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;javascript:;&quot; title=&quot;show inspiration&quot; class=&quot;button&quot; closedtext=&quot;inspiration&quot; closedtip=&quot;show inspiration&quot; openedtext=&quot;inspiration&quot; openedtip=&quot;hide inspiration&quot; hover=&quot;false&quot;&gt;inspiration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;floatingPanel&quot; transient=&quot;true&quot; style=&quot;display: none; left: 0px; top: 0px;&quot;&gt;&quot;So, you're like a Hulk now?&quot; She asked, putting her hand on Xander arm and feeling the muscle beneath. &quot;Wow, how much do you weigh now, or lift, oh my god, I bet you're stronger than Buffy now!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I don't know,&quot; Xander laughed as they walked out of the house into the night, ducking under the doorway as he did. &quot;They should have someone take a look at that, shoddy workmanship.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jennifer replied with a grin. &quot;We just knocked and it caved right in, no defence against door to door salesmen.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Somehow, I get the feeling that &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayanami_Rei&quot; title=&quot;External link to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayanami_Rei&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rei&lt;/a&gt; reading &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faust&quot; title=&quot;External link to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faust&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Faust&lt;/a&gt; would have interesting effects. (&lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5093352/1/Deus-ex-Evangelion&quot; title=&quot;External link to http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5093352/1/Deus-ex-Evangelion&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;inspiration&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Outsider comment regarding the crazy/fanatical Cylon Model Ones to use in an nBSG fic: *sigh* There's at least one in every family.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; How about a Futaba-kun Change fic that doesn't cross over with Ranma 1/2? (it would be a first)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; What other stories could be set in &quot;The Virus&quot;-verse? (eg. What series haven't been crossed in yet?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The world can always use more good fanfics for under-appreciated series like El Hazard, Sabre Marionette J, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Send someone who isn't the main character back in time to the beginning of the series. (bonus points if they're not even a main character)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Look into possible ways for the concept of &quot;&lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1046500/1/I_Was_A_Teenage_Dummy_Plug&quot; title=&quot;External link to http://www.fanfiction.net/s/1046500/1/I_Was_A_Teenage_Dummy_Plug&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;I Was A Teenage Dummy Plug&lt;/a&gt;&quot; to be applied to other source series.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; How about a &quot;self insert&quot; where the person admits to being godly but doesn't do anything godly because their preferred method of meddling is to use chaos theory to solve problems? (Preferring to use their omniscience rather than their omnipotence)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; How about a Beavis and Butthead gender-bend crackfic? (Inspired by something in &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2160751/1/&quot; title=&quot;External link to http://www.fanfiction.net/s/2160751/1/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Uhhhhh ok&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Try to get some inspiration from the comment about Utena and OMG-style valkyries on &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/45038318/&quot; title=&quot;External link to http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/45038318/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; If I can't find a decent implementation of the final author note from &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3107822/18/&quot; title=&quot;External link to http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3107822/18/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Wild Horse Thesis&lt;/a&gt;, then I should write it myself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Once I've finished figuring out how to model characters accurately and I've got a few stories under my belt, I should start completing the current story arcs on old Addventure favorites. Then I should try asking for permission to complete standalone fics, eventually working my way up to &quot;Forever The Tomboy&quot; and &quot;Girl Days&quot; once I hopefully have enough of a reputation to receive it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;You're forgetting that this is the guy who drinks a glass of chocolate milk by drinking the glass and throwing away the milk, which then explodes. For him, BLT probably means something like Begonia, Lead, and Tarantula... and that's assuming he wants to hit all three food groups.&quot; (animal, vegetable, and mineral)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ponder these for ideas:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Discworld:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Dumbledore has seven portraits but only six are known... because the seventh is hidden in the Patrician's palace in Ankh-Morpork where the magic field is so strong that Dumbledore's portrait self can step out of the portrait into reality in case of emergency. &lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt;

target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;chapter 39&lt;/a&gt; and plan a fic around them. (In essence, a Harry Potter (-ish) fic that mixes in a modern North American setting without completely throwing out the baby with the bathwater)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

<title>Chaos Leak</title>
<description>&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;TODO:&lt;/strong&gt; Think about this enough to come up with a concise description that doesn't throw the baby out with the bath water.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wrote the following comment to express my disappointment at an un-taken opportunity and then that got me thinking about possible plot-worthy implications of it...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;While I definitely enjoyed Screwball outwitting Starlight, it still feels a little disappointing that she just did something any old OC could do, rather than something uniquely Screwball like what came to mind for me the moment someone got the jump on her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I doubt the unmarking spell would work properly if cast on a changeling who's just mimicking a mark, so why should it work properly on a pony who's Discord's daughter and, thus, also &quot;outside designed parameters&quot;? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, It would have made all the sense in the world if, as with Discord, chaos is an inherent part of Screwball and, thus, emanating from all living parts of her being, rather than centered on some part. (I say &quot;living&quot; to rule out chaotic hair clippings and hoof filings.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then, as an aspect of her metaphysical self, her mark would count as a &quot;living part&quot; and would be an active source of chaos, even when separated from her. Cutting her off from it would simply cut off her ability to control it, causing it to slowly leak uncontrolled chaos into the Cutie Mark repository, ignoring or only being slowed down by containers designed to obstruct the flow of magic that's probably harmonic in nature and, thus, fairly opposite to Discord's.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; ssokolow @ &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fimfiction.net/story/302400/31/its-a-screwed-up-life/map-to-oh-you-gotta-be-kidding-me#comment/8344685&quot; title=&quot;External link to https://www.fimfiction.net/story/302400/31/its-a-screwed-up-life/map-to-oh-you-gotta-be-kidding-me#comment/8344685&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.fimfiction.net/story/302400/31/its-a-screwed-up-life/map-to-oh-you-gotta-be-kidding-me#comment/8344685&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;...for example:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Would the chaos leak just be a different way to resolve the situation or would it have lasting effects on the other cutie marks?&lt;br&gt;2. Is there any other situation where this concept could be applied, to increase the chances of it happening?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The problem is that, currently, my brain is fixated on the idea of some kind of lasting contamination of other cutie marks... and to do that would essentially writing two stories to re-create the pattern established by &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fimfiction.net/story/34702/why-am-i-pinkie-pie&quot; title=&quot;External link to https://www.fimfiction.net/story/34702/why-am-i-pinkie-pie&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Why Am I Pinkie Pie?&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fimfiction.net/story/55531/school-of-hard-knocks&quot; title=&quot;External link to https://www.fimfiction.net/story/55531/school-of-hard-knocks&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;School of Hard Knocks&lt;/a&gt; where the story I want requires conditions too distanced from canon to believably come about without a story to be a spin-off of. (And, now that I think about it, that &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; sort of what I'm going for. An entire arc following some background character's quest to either cure or learn to live with an under-mentioned leftover of the hero's quest of the week.)</description>

<title>Oops Effect</title>
<description>&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; What if, in reconstructing Commander Sheppard for Mass Effect 2, the process accidentally included a gender-swap?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No special reason. It's an opportunity for a gender-swap and it could be an interesting option for exploring either the author's vision of Sheppard or the social context of the Mass Effect universe in general.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important:&lt;/strong&gt; I generally don't like Mass Effect 2 and beyond, so I have a strong preference for the ridiculously implausible reconstruction from seeming nothing being the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; elements of post-ME1 continuity in the story. For some of the reasons why, check the links on the &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink null&quot; href=&quot;http://ssokolow.com/story_ideas.html#Mass Effect&quot; title=&quot;External link to http://ssokolow.com/story_ideas.html#Mass Effect&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; refresh=&quot;link&quot; tiddlylink=&quot;Mass Effect&quot;&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2017-07-28:&lt;/strong&gt; That said, &quot;no time to sedate for another couple of years and rebuild correctly&quot; is a good way to justify keeping Sheppard gender-swapped for the duration of the story, while not needing some &quot;Sheppard's gender identity changes&quot; magic BS to achieve a happy ending.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TODO:&lt;/strong&gt; Think of a more relevant title.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h1&gt;How could it happen?&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whether it's accidental, mistakenly perceived as the only option for salvaging damaged DNA, or actually a result of the limitations of the already magically-powerful recovery technique is up to the author. The result is what matters, not the process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most likely excuse for accidental would be one of the following leading the machine to &quot;repair&quot; the recovered DNA to the wrong gender:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Due to operational security, policy, or plain old overwork, the operator doesn't know the subject's original gender and guesstimates incorrectly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The operator of the machine put too much trust in the automation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Either way could result in the system restoring missing bits by either duplicating the X chromosome &quot;in better condition&quot; (male-to-female) or pulling a known good replacement chromosome (X or Y) from storage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If it's purposeful, I'd rather the person making the decision see it as a necessary evil (eg. the only way to make it work) rather than some kind of villainous means of manipulating Sheppard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2016-11-07:&lt;/strong&gt; Probably best to make it a comedy of errors centering around how compartmentalized TIM keeps knowledge in Cerberus.</description>

Now compare to the Ethereals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; 50,000 years is easily enough for Protheans to engineer their reading abilities into powerful psi abilities. (Hell, their beacons already have the appearance of telepathy in Mass Effect canon, regardless of how they actually work.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Any divergent technology can be explained as intentional R&amp;amp;D to escape the reaper technology trap.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br&gt;(The only fics I remember encountering had them as contemporaries of the Protheans.)</description>

<title>Ranma ½: Ignorant Edition</title>
<description>&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; Try writing a semi-fanfic based around my first impression of Ranma ½, back when the closest I knew to anime and manga were the Pokémon comics that came with Nintendo Power.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  This is a story about a boy who turns into a girl, his father who turns into a panda, and the weird Chinese curse that did it to them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;That summary was in the back of a Pokemon comic I got for free. I was curious but didn't try to get it. (No disposable income) I though the curse change was permanent (stuck in their cursed forms) and I assumed that they had both fallen in a single, solitary cursed spring somewhere in China. (Maybe at a shrine, temple, tomb, or off in the wilderness)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I had already seen a preview for the first Ranma movie although my memories of it were a bit hazy. My memories haven't really faded that much since then (I kept them once I realized what Ranma ½ was), there was a clip of Happosai becoming airborne thanks to a kick by Ranma, a clip of Kirin's flying ship arriving (and/or Kirin arriving on the ship), a clip of Akane being pulled up to the ship, and the &quot;Ranma, please come rescue me before I'm married to Kirin&quot; soundbyte from the preview's narration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I saw Ranma (female or male?) punt Happosai into the air in the preview for the first movie but I didn't didn't know who they were. It is important that I remember the impression I got of Happosai I got from that blurry memory. (A diminuitive old man, probably a martial artist, capable of taking a fair bit of damage, and someone who the character doing the kicking (Ranma, but I didn't know that) disliked. It may be possible to refresh the feeling my reviewing my preconceptions of Dragonball.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I had no idea who was cursed so I ran through several possible scenarios when I heard Akane say &quot;Ranma, please come rescue me before I'm married to Kirin&quot; in the preview for the first movie. One such possibility being that the cursed character was the one in danger of being married off. (I hadn't retained any knowledge which would confirm that the cursed person was the one doing the rescuing)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;Katana&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Hmm, fun. Maybe some sort of curse that reflects what they need to learn? (from vengeful spirit/god/etc. that somebody annoyed?) Though what Genma could stand to learn from a panda, I don't know. Abstinence? Okay, bad joke. So, permanent curse... or maybe, the curse will be lifted once they meet certain conditions? That could be entertaining. Maybe Ranma winds up in positions best suited for the damsel in distress as part of the curse, and circumstances often contrive to make her incapable of escaping independently?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;ssokolow&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I'll have to think about that and get back to you. Semi-fanfics require my full faculties to ponder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>

<title>Well, I Didn't Vote For You!</title>
<description>&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; How about a story where first-contact war leaves a humanity with a propensity to spin off disgruntled break-away states and terrorist groups (of a different character than Cerberus).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After reading the fics mentioned under &quot;Inspiration&quot; it occurred to me that, given human nature, the discovery of the prothean ruins on Mars resulting in a unified Earth government is a bit of a case of &quot;Bioware wrote it this way because author says so&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As humans, we're a fractious bunch and, even in this day and age, we still sometimes see new countries being fissioned off. It would make perfect sense if, by the time Mass Effect rolls around, humanity is either still on the United Nations model of global politics or has an uneasy world government which would shatter like glass when some parts of humanity declare that the world leaders did not have the authority and, thus, the citadel council's political standing is invalid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That would then produce a cauldron of unrest which would periodically produce attempts at breakaway republics and terrorist groups defined not by their decision to practice asymmetric warfare the way Cerberus does (the breakaway republics would also be doing that) but by their actual use of terror tactics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, I'd need to think about some way to make the breakaway republics more interesting than just an ongoing sparkle of &quot;rebellion... pacified&quot; around human space. (I'd want to research unconventional &quot;nations&quot; and see how all kinds of nations could be applied to a space contect.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...how exactly does the whole &quot;need to discharge the drive core&quot; part work? Is there any way a breakaway state could, at thought-to-be-prohibitive expense, develop some kind of solution for getting outside the normal selection of worlds? (eg. Would it be possible to build a &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll&quot; title=&quot;External link to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Matryoshka&lt;/a&gt; ship where the built-up charge is discarded along with each shell+engines layer? What about some kind of normally-prohibitive method of capturing the charge and then discarding the capture vessel/material?)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maybe I could bluff the readers with a line analogous to &quot;With no Relay, it will make a direct jump to the Citadel, but will need significant work done on its engines before it will fly again.&quot; from &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10454482/19/Early-Discovery&quot; title=&quot;External link to https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10454482/19/Early-Discovery&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Early Discovery, Chapter 19&lt;/a&gt; where, because I just take it for granted that it's possible, the &quot;destructively long survivable jump&quot; comes across as &quot;the author knows what he's doing, but explaining it would dilute the story as a whole&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Either way, it'd be primarily about the politics rather than the tech anyway so I don't want to let thinking about that side-track me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TODO:&lt;/strong&gt; Read the Wikipedia article on &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_warfare&quot; title=&quot;External link to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_warfare&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;asymmetric warfare&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; If done believably, it's also possible that an advantage could be had as a result of surviving a &quot;suicidal gambit&quot; and making a technological breakthrough as a result of it.

<title>Cursed! Whodunnit?</title>
<description>&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; One day, without warning, Hinako turns male. Shortly afterwards, Hiroshi and Daisuke reveal that they've been cursed for several months already but they kept it a secret. The game is afoot and the question on everybody's mind is &quot;How did Ranma's curse become contagious, why now, and why THEM? After all, Akane spends plenty of time around Ranma and nobody has started turning into a panda.&quot; Cursed! Whodunnit?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink null&quot; href=&quot;http://ssokolow.com/story_ideas.html#Cursed! Whodunnit? - Attempt&quot; title=&quot;External link to http://ssokolow.com/story_ideas.html#Cursed! Whodunnit? - Attempt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; refresh=&quot;link&quot; tiddlylink=&quot;Cursed! Whodunnit? - Attempt&quot;&gt;Experimental Attempt at Writing It&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Story Structure:&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt; Main Story: A Whodunnit-style story beginning with Hinako getting &quot;spontaneously cursed&quot; and ending, at the earliest, once they know what's going on. (Though that'll probably just be the main subplot. Seeing how Yuka and Sayuri deal with the curse and react to Hiro and Dai's curses could be good fun too.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Prequel to be read afterwards: A view of how Hiroshi and Daisuke reacted to getting cursed, how they kept it secret, their motivations for doing so, and what they did with their curses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Subplots for the main story:&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt; The whodunnit&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hinako (In cursed form, 'he' is stable at an in-between age. This gives the clarity necessary to see the extremes she bounces between. With that, she can figure out what she's done for her students, both good and bad, and so on. The conflict is that she wants to go back to normal but she doesn't want to lose that clarity.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Yuka and Sayuri (&quot;Cliché&quot; pretty much doesn't exist when dealing with female-to-male transformation and, if we decide that they're currently dating or considering dating Hiroshi and Daisuke, then we REALLY have some fun options. Probably best to make a clean break from male-to-female cliché by having the guys be the experienced once. Additional fun can be had if, once they're used to being guys, Yuka and Sayuri decide to take the intiative and not only date Hiro and Dai, but suggest things Hiro and Dai either never considered or decided against intially... but not girl training. That brings back the cliché.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Herb (Lime and Mint end up cursed before this story even starts because of how much Herb blasts them. However, Herb doesn't know why until he receives a letter from Ranma detailing the events of this story up to a certain point. However, while dragon heritage provides for ki production and control, damping isn't so easy. This results in a character crisis (he's almost certain to eventually curse his bride) until Ranma comes up with a solution. However, he has to put his pride on the line to let Ranma teach him. Lime and Mint get cured... by force (Hinako) if need be.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Subplots not needed:&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt; Kasumi seems unaffected by getting cursed and serenely trusts that Ranma will find a cure. This really gets on Akane's nerves... especially since some of Kasumi's mannerisms really don't fit with a male body. (As a plus, periodic cut-aways to Kasumi can entertainingly build on the underlying theme.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Nabiki is pretty imperturbable. She'll just end up deciding to keep the curse so that she can become a male business tycoon if need be. After all, by this time, it'll be obvious that only Ranma has the water magnetism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Kuno may get cursed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Rules:&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Ranma's curse taints his ki. Prolonged exposure to Ranma's curse causes peoples' ki to slowly become curse-tainted. Enough taint and you start changing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The osmotic taint only works for gender-curses because other curses are &quot;too much work&quot; to implement. (Complete genetic rewrite for most, Large mass change for age curses, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Male-to-female curses are much easier than female-to-male curses because no Y chromosome needs to be synthesized.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Also, Hiroshi and Daisuke have been hanging around Ranma long before Hinako showed up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Cursed people are immune. (Genma, Shampoo, Taro, Mousse, Ryoga)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Happosai's ability to drain and convert female ki has taught him to filter what he draws but he knows what's going on and he finds it hilarious. He doesn't tell anyone because he's a jerk that way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hinako is the most vulnerable female because of her draining ability and how frequently she uses it on Ranma.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Her &quot;Happo no Yen Coin Return&quot; doesn't purge her ki system because her techniques make a distinction between native and foreign ki. Because it would probably bring her back to her original weakened state, she never flares her native ki.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Draining Ranma's ki is similar to glomping onto him for several hours while having weakened defenses. That's why she picks up a curse much more quickly than Yuka and Sayuri.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Cologne has never heard of this because it's really the first time population density, ki mastery, huge ki reserves, and a gender curse have combined in this fashion.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; The amazons know that a gender-cursed mother will give birth to gender-cursed children, but not why. Other kinds of curses don't spread this way because 9 months isn't enough exposure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Herb probably hasn't heard of this either, given how the Musk feel about gender-segregation.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; It doesn't help that neither the Amazons nor the Musk have an equivalent to &quot;sit three feet away from a cursed ki adept for six to eight hours, six days a week&quot;. (school)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The curses won't make Hiroshi and Daisuke into water magnets. Maybe it only works for Ki adepts who fight their curses. (The old &quot;chi in turmoil&quot; explanation)&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Note: The explanation doesn't really matter as long as Hiro, Dai, Yuka, Sayuri, and our choice of anyone who inherits a gender curse are free of water magnetism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Akane isn't the first girl to get cursed because flaring your aura (in her case, getting angry) helps to flush the taint out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Kasumi is the second girl to get cursed after Hinako. (Not only does Ranma live there, Kasumi does his laundry. If Happosai can get charged by panties, then Kasumi can get tainted by laundry)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Yuka and Sayuri are the third and fourth girls to get cursed. No boys other than Hiro and Dai have been cursed yet. (Ranma keeps his aura controlled and they're the only non-immune (Akane) people other than Hiro and Dai who spend that much time in range)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Ranma will learn to control his ki to prevent further tainting by the end of the story and will teach Herb and probably Cologne too so it can be recorded for future generations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hinako can cure someone by draining them twice in rapid succession. However, the taint regenerates once you're cursed, so accidental curing by non-consecutive drains is impossible. Two drains will render a person unconscious for 12 to 24 hours but do no permanent damage. The body won't allow fatal amounts of ki to be drained. Cologne explains this so they'll allow it to be done.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Nabiki gets cursed fifth: After Kasumi is changed, Ranma starts to think that the change has something to do with him. When Akane's friends are affected as well, he's completely confused. In a concerted attempt to find out what's going on, he and Nabiki, who's helping him because she's worried for Kasumi, spend days sifting through books on Jusenkyo at the Cat Cafe and Dr. Tofu's. During this time, Ranma's using his aura to keep himself awake, and heavily exposing Nabiki. When Nabiki is changed, Ranma finally realizes, at least basically, what's going on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;deitarion&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; In essence, if you're a martial artist, you're unlikely to get cursed via osmosis. If you're cursed (doesn't matter how) you only spread it via osmosis if you're a strong martial artist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;weebee&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; the main themes of the ending, IMHO, are what happens when Ranma finds out the mechanics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;weebee&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; he knows he'll lose control of his aura occasionally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;weebee&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; what will he do about it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;weebee&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Then again, with Nabiki and at least one of the couples HAPPY about it, that may not matter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Questions to be Answered:&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do Hiroshi and Daisuke's parents already know about their curses before Hinako spontaneously gains one?&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;weebee&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; It's entirely possible that the families know, but the boys have convinced them not to tell for several reasons.&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt; The families don't know that Hiro and Dai are harmless letchers,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Well, let's face it, having a son that turns into a girl is rather embarassing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;weebee&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; ...though revealing it in the main story could be amusing, too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Do we want to curse Gosunkugi in order to set up for a &quot;Gos + Girl = Goth = People taking interest &lt;code&gt;--&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; Why!?&quot; joke?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Ideas:&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Maybe Daisuke can borrow one of his mother's old wigs for his female form until his hair grows out. (Either the wig will match his natural color or &quot;she&quot; will claim she had the hairstylist dye her hair back to its natural color when his real hair looks apropriately androgynous)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; &quot;How did you keep this a secret for so long?&quot; &quot;I dunno. We just don't seem to attract water the way you do... or trouble for that matter.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; By the time Yuka and Sayuri reach saturation point, they'll be so resigned to the probability of it that when one of them transforms in school, 'he' will jokingly turn to some of the other girls and respond with &quot;Ok... does anyone have a pickle jar they need help with?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Notes:&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hiroshi's hairstyle looks half credible as a girl's cut but Daisuke would need to grow his bangs down in the side not to look really odd as a girl. A hairstyle change could play a part in the plot. (&quot;And here I thought Dai only started growin' that ponytail ta copy me or somethin.&quot; or something equivalent)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Subplot timelines need to be written. Possibly using HTML tables to get parallel columns, one per subplot.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hiroshi and Daisuke's curses aren't going to kick in at the same time (too implausible) so, In the prequel, it's a given that the phrase &quot;Can I touch them?&quot; will get used at least once. A good response would probably be something along the lines of &quot;Not now. I haven't even had a chance yet.&quot; but with more effort made to make it funny.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;weebee&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  Hmm, now that I think of it, this isn't a disease. It's radiation exposure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;deitarion&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Heh heh heh. That's great. &quot;The Virus&quot; turns the curse into a disease. I'm turning it into radiation poisoning. :P&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(12:28:53) deitarion:&lt;/strong&gt; First, a simple thought that, once the news of the extra curses has spread enough for the  administration to not take issue with it, I'd like Hiro and Dai to come  to school in female form in borrowed uniforms at the request of some of  the girls. It'd be an opportunity to flesh out characters all around.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(12:31:11) deitarion:&lt;/strong&gt; ...but especially the female characters. Of all the bits in the Ranma anime that I enjoyed, the one that felt the most unique and memorable was probably Ukyo having fun playing with Ranma's curse. (The part that, in the dub, ended with &quot;I'm not a plaything!&quot;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(12:32:18) weebee:&lt;/strong&gt; always preferred &quot;I'm not a toy,&quot; but that dub was mostly okay, so meh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(12:32:45) deitarion:&lt;/strong&gt; I prefer that too, but it's been too long and audio stick in my mind better than subtitles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(12:32:52) deitarion:&lt;/strong&gt; sticks*&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(12:32:55) deitarion:&lt;/strong&gt; Same reason I enjoyed Boku no Futatsu no Tsubasa. Anime and manga have a frustrating tendency to mute the fact that girls are human beings too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(12:32:57) weebee:&lt;/strong&gt; Hiroshi and Daisuke are taking this pretty  well all around, so it could be all right. Though having someone should almost certainly flip out over it a bit more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(12:33:28) deitarion:&lt;/strong&gt; Remember, the plot summary says &quot;Shortly afterwards, Hiroshi and Daisuke reveal that they've been cursed for several months already but they kept it a secret.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(12:33:42) weebee:&lt;/strong&gt; agreed,&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(12:33:46) weebee:&lt;/strong&gt; they still took it pretty well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(12:33:53) weebee:&lt;/strong&gt; being capable of keeping it secret, especially.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(12:34:49) deitarion:&lt;/strong&gt; I've always had a fondness for the idea that there be some way to appease the rule of funny so the water magnet effect goes away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(12:35:48) weebee:&lt;/strong&gt; well, it doesnt even need to be rule of funny, that's not what I meant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(12:35:57) weebee:&lt;/strong&gt; though I suppose their parents might have found out and not told.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(12:36:07) weebee:&lt;/strong&gt; the initial flipout would at least give it away to them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(12:36:32) weebee:&lt;/strong&gt; anyhow, it's easy to explain no water magnetism, or much less. Curse is weaker since it's a 'secondary infection,' and the gender change itself is more important.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(12:37:42) deitarion:&lt;/strong&gt; That'd actually work well since the parents could help provide the cash for the latter part of &quot;Daisuke or Hiroshi: A little time alone with some cold water clears up a  lot of mysteries. Getting leered at and hit on while out to buy some  girl clothes... more than I wanted.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(12:38:11) weebee:&lt;/strong&gt; yeah, presumably.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(12:38:21) deitarion:&lt;/strong&gt; This IS Furinkan-cho. It's somewhat canon that people are desensitized to crazy things happening.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(12:38:44) weebee:&lt;/strong&gt; make this a &quot;Meh&quot; nerima similar to Help Wanted's, and the parents could even just be like &quot;I told you hanging out with that Ranma boy woul dbe trouble...&quot; or something.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(12:39:16) weebee:&lt;/strong&gt; whole bunch of ways to take it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(12:39:24) deitarion:&lt;/strong&gt; *snicker* Yup.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Reference:&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;http://furinkan.com/ranma/characters/daisuke.html&quot; title=&quot;External link to http://furinkan.com/ranma/characters/daisuke.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Daisuke &amp;amp; Hiroshi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;http://furinkan.com/ranma/characters/yuka.html&quot; title=&quot;External link to http://furinkan.com/ranma/characters/yuka.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yuka &amp;amp; Sayuri&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Note to Self: If I ever need the chatlogs with weebee, I believe everything was discussed in one fairly long chat on 2009-03-28.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Timeline: (Under Development)&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Ranma begins Ki training around the time of the Amaguriken. Ranma's aura, tainted with the Jusenkyo curse, begins radiating into his near surroundings. This effect will continue to strengthen as his training continues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hinako arrives and begins draining Ranma's aura.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Herb arrives, battles Ranma, and then returns to China.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Lime and Mint reach taint saturation, having absorbed it quickly from constant exposure and frequently being on the receiving end of Ki blasts. They manifest curses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Hiroshi and Daisuke reach saturation point (when? Volume 36?) but decide to keep it a secret.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; There should be a day or two between them since it's more or less impossible that they'd get equal exposure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Main story starts here.&lt;/strong&gt; Hinako reaches saturation point a few weeks after the end of the manga. (Volume 38) Hiroshi and Daisuke reveal their own curses at this point.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;[&lt;/strong&gt;Somewhere in here, Yuka, Sayuri, and Kasumi reach saturation point. Ranma starts to get seriously concerned.&lt;strong&gt;]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Nabiki gets involved, helping Ranma search for a cure for Kasumi's sake.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Ranma sends a letter to Herb asking if he knows of anything like this.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Nabiki reaches saturation point within three days of working with Ranma. Ranma realizes the basic mechanics of the process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Ranma, Nabiki, and Cologne begin to try and determine the specifics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; A few days to a few weeks pass, depending on the needs of subplots.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Herb Arrives with Lime and Mint.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;TODO:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;lt;How much time passes in here?&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Ranma and Cologne figure out the cure to the problem, Ranma devises a method to supress his own aura totally, based on Dr. Tofu's old technique and the Umisenken, and he teaches it to Herb. Kasumi gets cured.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; End of story?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

<title>Cursed! Whodunnit? - Attempt</title>
<description>&lt;strong&gt;See Also:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink null&quot; href=&quot;http://ssokolow.com/story_ideas.html#Cursed! Whodunnit?&quot; title=&quot;External link to http://ssokolow.com/story_ideas.html#Cursed! Whodunnit?&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; refresh=&quot;link&quot; tiddlylink=&quot;Cursed! Whodunnit?&quot;&gt;Cursed! Whodunnit?&lt;/a&gt; (story plan)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Another English class, another day of boredom,&quot; Ranma thought to himself. Everything was ordinary. Students doing very little studying, Miss Hinako doing very little teaching, and Ranma with little to do but nap and toss the odd distraction in the general direction of their variably-aged teacher.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was at that moment that things decided to go from normal to abnormal and did so even more quickly than was normal for Nerima. Miss Hinako had been firmly focused on finding the best way to combine her strawberry milk with the lemon lolipop Ranma had given her five minutes ago when the elastic on one one of her shoes slipped and she took a tumble, sending her milk flying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an instant, two very strange things had happened. The cold liquid hadn't, as it always did, somehow ended up on Ranma Saotome but, instead, on Miss Hinako herself, who had gone from a young girl to a teenage boy in a tight, yellow dress in the blink of an eye. Ranma just blinked lazily for a second, a yawn almost coming to his lips, before that last observation rammed its way through his sleep- and boredom-fogged mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wait... Miss Hinako had just turned into a man? He blinked slowly several times, the unreal image refusing to go away. The week's weirdness quota was now well and truly satisfied.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cursed! Whodunnit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By: deitarion/SSokolow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, for most schools, a teacher spontaneously changing gender in front of a class would be followed fairly quickly and abruptly by some combination of shocked silence, confusion, and panic... but, given their history with the insane, the bizarre, and the just plain stupid, the students of Furinkan High (and especially those of class 1-F) can be excused for having slightly higher standards. After a few furtive glances at each other, the thankfully principal-free windows and door, and their own secondary-sex characteristics (not necessarily in that order), normal operation resumed and the class, as one, began reacting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marked&quot;&gt;TODO:&lt;/span&gt; Finish thinking on how Miss Hinako would react. Given how Genma didn't seem to even notice his curse at first, and how Ranma, once used to his curse, often doesn't even notice he's changed, and that Hinako is quite used to transformation of a different sort, I think it's quite plausible that it would take her a few moments to realize that she's no longer in a familiar form. (Likely as a result of a &quot;Do I have something on my face&quot;-esque thought in response to the class's behaviour)&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(19:28:49) jonakhensu:&lt;/strong&gt; also, the one problem I saw for Hinako not noticing she changed: panties not being at all comfortable on a guy- is lessened by the fact that she probably doesn't wear any&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(19:33:37) ssokolow:&lt;/strong&gt; *nod* Doubt she'd be able to find something that sits equally well on her small and large forms and, as with one of the fanon tracks for Ranma's curse, I doubt she'll ever have a period unless she can stay in adult form for at least a month.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marked&quot;&gt;Potential fragment:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While this was going on, Akane had been busy weighing the evidence and, based on long experience, had reached the highly prescient (though still tentative) conclusion that this was all Ranma's fault, as usual.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;marked&quot;&gt;Potential narrative response to a line of dialogue:&lt;/span&gt; suave to stupid in &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; seconds flat. (with the number being how long the dialogue would take to say.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h1&gt; Random Idea Fragment (100% Raw)&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Write: Hiroshi and Daisuke admit they've already been cursed for several months.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;??? (probably female): &quot;So that's why you have been less pervy lately? I thought Akane finally scared you into toning it down.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hiroshi or Daisuke (Mock affronted tone, if it's not too &quot;Weasley Twins&quot;): We were sharing classes with Akane long before Ranma was keeping her busy. Why do you think she's the only person who calls Ranma a pervert?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Daisuke or Hiroshi: A little time alone with some cold water clears up a lot of mysteries. Getting leered at and hit on while out to buy some girl clothes... more than I wanted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Probably immediately followed with Ranma asking why the heck they'd want to buy girl clothes and Hiro/Dai responding with &quot;Not everyone wants to be the center of attention, 'pigtailed girl'.&quot; with that last bit in a teasing tone.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, I think, once the news of the extra curses has spread enough for the administration to not take issue with it, I'd like Hiro and Dai to come to school in female form in borrowed uniforms at the request of some of the girls. It'd be an opportunity to flesh out characters all around.</description>

<title>Self-Deception, Changeling-Style</title>
<description>&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; When changelings encounter problems, our habit is to hide... even from ourselves, it seems. I couldn't bear to confront my past, so I tried to just leave it behind and let the guilt and remorse die with the name I'd forsaken and the face I shunned. ...it didn't work very well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inspiration:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fimfiction.net/story/75755/3/molded-to-love/scars-of-the-past&quot; title=&quot;External link to http://www.fimfiction.net/story/75755/3/molded-to-love/scars-of-the-past&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.fimfiction.net/story/75755/3/molded-to-love/scars-of-the-past&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TODO:&lt;/strong&gt; Brainstorm interpretations of that dialogue snippet.</description>

<title>Not Your Ordinary Cutie Mark</title>
<description>&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; Stories have made some great justifications for the nature of cutie marks being cultural... what if exceptional circumstances could alter their position or nature in more exceptional ways?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some stories have put a lot of thought into the nature of cutie marks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, in &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fimfiction.net/story/57315/13/the-xenophiles-guide-to-equestria/ponies-behaving-badly&quot; title=&quot;External link to https://www.fimfiction.net/story/57315/13/the-xenophiles-guide-to-equestria/ponies-behaving-badly&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Xenophile's Guide to Equestria, Chapter 13 (Ponies Behaving Badly&lt;/a&gt;, a deeply-considered and perfectly canon-reasonable argument is made for how much of the form cutie marks take is nurture, not nature. (ie. not only is the iconography based on what the subject is familiar with, but things like marks running may come and go as societies change.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Given that and how loosely defined the whole setting is, why not a story built around coming to terms with some kind of &quot;extremely exceptional circumstances produce something well outside the normal bounds of 'cutie mark'&quot; as the driving conflict?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inspiration:&lt;/strong&gt; Just a random thought when I was looking at a scene from the cartoon and thinking about how it makes sense to put an athletic contestant's number over their cutie mark because, with their cutie mark being probably the most distinctive single feature on their body, habit would probably draw the eyes there when trying to remember who someone is.</description>

<title>...More Like Queen Bee</title>
<description>&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; Psychologically, changelings are basically a fourth pony tribe with equivalent reproductive biology and queens like Chrysalis are a product of an ancient ritual. (But, depending on how the idea is fleshed out, the changelings may have forgotten that.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead of being natural or essential, changeling queens are a safeguard against extinction through population collapse crafted by changeling mages back in the mists of antiquity... sort of like Leeloo from The Fifth Element (a genetically-perfect being) implemented in a manner similar to the Slayer line in Buffy the Vampire Slayer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Point: Changelings Are Essentially Ponies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; However the author decides to handle changelings feeding on emotions (essential nutrient, required to use their horns, or even just a power booster), there does exist at least one way in which they can feed non-destructively enough to sustainably join a society.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Changelings are in the same neurological ballpark as ponies, griffins, minotaurs, and other intelligent, civilized species and any barbarism present is cultural.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Queens are not an essential part of the changeling lifecycle, society, culture, or psychology... though they may have forgotten that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; While it's up to the author whether changelings have any kind of telepathy, if they have a hive mind, it doesn't grant queens any special extra ability to subvert other changelings' wills above and beyond any mind-control spells they may already know.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Point: Changeling Queens Weren't Evolved&lt;/h2&gt;Long ago (Possibly Discord's reign but I think I'd prefer to set it in the pre-unification period), the changeling species saw itself in dire straits (whether through war, a wildly varying food supply, or something else).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a desperate attempt to stave off their seemingly invevitable extinction, a group of the brightest changeling mages worked together to design and implement an enchantment on the entire species which would implement a genetic life raft: The Changeling Queen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Changeling queens are defined by several differences from regular changelings:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; There must always be at least one.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; If the only queen is killed, a changeling somewhere will begin to undergo what could be described as a second puberty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The spell will prefer female changelings but, if the author doesn't build in a &quot;the last male changeling in the world would become a queen&quot; clause, they must believably argue that it wasn't for lack of trying on the mages' parts. (After all, there's always the possibility that the last males and the last females could get separated and then the females could die.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; It's up to the author whether more than one queen is possible. My intuition says that the best choice would be to have queens able to choose to have daughters who are also queens but that there's some downside to it, either biological or cultural.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; It could be as simple as &quot;Why should I have an heir? She's just going to try to depose me.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; It could be that queens have their magical enhancements from the start and, as such, run their parents/guardians even more ragged than usual.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; If the author decides changelings have a hive mind, maybe it's an integral part of how the spell was cast and how it detects and implements recovery from the loss of the last queen. (Which could also open up interesting avenues for plots based on a new queen being &quot;called&quot; because the old one was broken from the link, either temporarily or permanently, without being killed.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Their bodies are too resource intensive to be a feasible transformation to slowly apply to the full changeling population.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; They are as genetically perfect as the mages could make them so that they can repopulate an entire species without birth defects from inbreeding.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; It's up to the author whether parthenogenesis is possible but, given that they already feed on emotions, I'm rather partial to the idea of a queen being able to have as many one-night stands as she wants in order to build genetic diversity. Hey, if things like Griffins and Discord can exist, why not a spell which ensures maximum genetic compatibility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Aside from increased rather than decreased fertility, they have been engineered to take a similar role to the role Pak Protectors play relative to species like Humans in Larry Niven's Known Space universe.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Their lifespan and memory are significantly enhanced so they can act as living repositories of knowledge until society is re-established.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Their magical and physical abilities are superior to other changeling to ensure maximum survivability of themselves and any dependent offspring.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Their bodies are engineered to support an alternative, insect-like reproductive cycle so that maximum population growth can be achieved by offloading as much of the gestation period as possible onto previous generations of offspring. (Think marsupials or seahorses who use a hive rather than a pouch.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, despite all this, the creators of this grand plan were operating under a time crunch and were merely mortal, they cut some corners and relied a little too much on optimism so who knows how much might have been forgotten about the nature and purpose of queens. For all we know, the author might decide that changelings think their queen is blessed by some deity with a divine right to rule.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inspiration:&lt;/strong&gt; Chrysalis's mental monologue on the ability of her children to breed and have children of their own without birth defects in &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fimfiction.net/story/134427/4/never-judge-a-bug-by-her-cover-chrysaliss-royal-break-up-chronicle/my-ass-is-damn-fine&quot; title=&quot;External link to http://www.fimfiction.net/story/134427/4/never-judge-a-bug-by-her-cover-chrysaliss-royal-break-up-chronicle/my-ass-is-damn-fine&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Never Judge a Bug By Her Cover: Chrysalis's Royal Break-up Chronicle, Chapter 4&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Miss Effect</title>
<description>&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; What about a story set in the future of the Mass Effect universe where the Reapers missed humanity because we fled?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inspiration:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;javascript:;&quot; title=&quot;show This quote&quot; class=&quot;button&quot; closedtext=&quot;This quote&quot; closedtip=&quot;show This quote&quot; openedtext=&quot;This quote&quot; openedtip=&quot;hide This quote&quot; hover=&quot;false&quot;&gt;This quote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;floatingPanel&quot; transient=&quot;true&quot; style=&quot;display: none; left: 0px; top: 0px;&quot;&gt;&quot;Suddenly we were confronted with the realization that we were going to be facing the apocalypse. It practically drove us mad. Most of our leaders had no idea what to do, others used it as an excuse to hoard more power. This led to the Alliance being formed, just so that we had some plan, but we still weren't sure what we would do. Flee, hide, or fight.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sighing, Davis continued. &quot;Ultimately we chose to fight. Not everyone was happy with that decision, or how we came to it, but it's what we chose.&quot;&lt;/div&gt; in &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9815459/10/Future-History&quot; title=&quot;External link to https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9815459/10/Future-History&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Future History, Chapter 10&lt;/a&gt; and the comment in an earlier chapter that some human separatists, lifespan extended to 300 years by nanotech medicine, fled to Andromeda... a trip that's expected to only take 150 years because they'll go much faster once their non-eezo FTL drives clear the hyperspace muck churned up by millennia of eezo FTL use.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; While it would inherently go in a completely different direction than what I'd envisioned, &quot;humans are from another galaxy and arrive before the harvest&quot; can also be entertaining. (A thought inspired by &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9001395/1/Fifty-Shades-of-Overkill&quot; title=&quot;External link to https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9001395/1/Fifty-Shades-of-Overkill&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fifty Shades of Overkill&lt;/a&gt; in which Mass Effect takes place when the future of the Halo-verse starts colonizing another galaxy.)</description>

<title>Do it over, n00b!</title>
<description>&lt;strong&gt;Description:&lt;/strong&gt; How about a &quot;life is a game&quot; story where more than one character is getting a do-over and they can see each others' HUD announcements and the Steam-style achievements cause humorous strife?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inspiration:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;John sighed as he shook his head &quot;Fine...but what should we do now with the others?&quot; Jane sighed as well &quot;Come up with an excuse of course,&quot; She said. &quot;I'll just say I'm your sister or something.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;John nodded, &quot;Sure,&quot; he said, and the two moved out from behind the Crates, however Jane did not see the small grin that was on John's face.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Ok, now that we've calmed down a bit,&quot; Jane said, &quot;I can explain a bit more. As it turns out, I am John's Sis-&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;She's my Wife.&quot; John interrupted her, &quot;She just pissed that I haven't been home for so long, that's why she pulled a gun on me.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The others just looked at John Gaping, none more so than Jane herself. John just grins at her, and as he walks past her he whispers &quot;No one pulls a gun on Commander John Shepard and gets away with it.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achievement Unlocked: Don't F**k with the Shepard (Shepard must put someone back in their place)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;—&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;externalLink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8264615/3/Mass-Effect-Life-is-a-Game&quot; title=&quot;External link to https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8264615/3/Mass-Effect-Life-is-a-Game&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mass Effect: Life Is A Game, Chapter 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description>
